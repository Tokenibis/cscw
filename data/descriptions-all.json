Montessori inspires and nurtures student\u2019s interests in learning through hands-on educational techniques and child-centered learning.

Students leave school \u201csounding out words, making books, writing pages of addition problems (for fun!), and schooling you about how to respect, reuse and recycle!\u201d (Wendy Miner Ashby, Parent, MRGC).\nThe Friends of Montessori Foundation (FOMF) was established to support the Montessori of the Rio Grande as it switched from a private educational facility to a public charter school (Montessori of the Rio Grande Charter, MRGC) six years ago. A typical private Montessori education costs around $12,000.00 a year, ours is completely free. This translates to a diverse student population serving Hispanics and Caucasians in equal proportion as well as 10% special needs students incorporated at all times in classrooms.\n",

ANA member groups are based in the communities most immediately affected by U.S. nuclear weapons policy and by environmental contamination.\nANA has had major impacts on many local, site-related decisions, such as at Fernald, in Ohio, Rocky Flats, in Colorado, and at the Nevada Test Site. One of the reasons is that ANA has helped to change the way that issues are framed. Rather than allowing the Department of Energy and others to define problems as purely local, ANA has exposed them as part of larger issues. Groups are now able to link themselves to national campaigns against a corrupt system. This means that local agendas are no longer defined as \u201cNIMBY\u201d (Not In My Backyard). Instead, activists look for solutions that do not shift the burden of risks onto others.\nThe reasons for ANA\u2019s successes are many. Paramount is its continued commitment to grassroots organizing, to taking on a system rather than piecemeal problems, and to enhancing collaboration. ANA sponsors meetings around the country and facilitates frequent conference calls and email interaction to ensure that knowledge is shared and ideas are discussed \u2013 so that broad consensus on strategies can emerge.\n",
