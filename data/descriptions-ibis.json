A group of students and professors at the University decided to start a crisis center where anyone could call to talk about whatever was on their mind. It had to be free...it had to be confidential...it had to be compassionate. Thus, Agora was begun as one of the first crisis centers of its kind in the United States. \r\n\r\nSince then, nearly 5000 volunteers have served on our crisis line, and hundreds of thousands of callers have been helped. Who calls us? Teens call to talk about bullying, college students call to talk about school, parents call to talk about their children, elders call to talk about loneliness, and many others. \r\n\r\n## What We Do\r\n\r\nSometimes it's hard to talk about our problems with family and friends. As trained crisis hotline specialists, our volunteers are ready to provide compassionate, non-judgmental help for anyone in need of emotional support. Anyone is welcome to use our service, and you do not need to be \"in crisis\" to call or chat with us. \r\n\r\nAt Agora, we won't tell you how to solve your problem, but we'll help you figure out what options you might have. Agora provides many services including an all-issues crisis phone line, is part of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline network, an on-line chat service, the only Substance Abuse hotline in New Mexico, have access to an extensive referral database, and offer a range of training and educational outreach options for the community.\r\n\r\nWe specialize in compassionate listening services for anyone who is experiencing a crisis in their life. When you call us you can expect to be greeted by a trained crisis specialist who will listen to anything you want to talk about in a safe and supportive manner.\r\n\r\n## Who Calls Us? \r\n\r\nParents, students, teens, seniors, bereaved , medical professionals, teachers, veterans, LGBTQAA, and you!\r\n\r\nReasons to call us:\r\n\r\n* You're just stressed\r\n\r\n* jobs loss\r\n\r\n* family issues\r\n\r\n* grief\r\n\r\n* work related stress\r\n\r\n* feeling under pressure\r\n\r\n* struggling with a medical diagnosis\r\n\r\n* you/someone you care about is struggling with addiction\r\n\r\n* death of a loved one\r\n\r\n* in need of a referral for service\r\n\r\n* you are having thoughts of suicide\r\n\r\nWhen you call our help-line, we won't ask your name - only your zip code and a few other anonymous questions which help us secure funding. Our service is confidential and offered free of charge. We have many callers who need help, so if you don't get through at first it is because our volunteers are already on calls. Please know that we want to talk with you, so call back or leave us a message so we can call you.",

This seemed to be particularly true of women, some of whom had over a hundred bookings frequently for minor offenses such as littering and public nuisance. We were improving conditions for them in the jail, but they were being turned out to the streets with no chance of making a new life-no shelter, no job, no mental health care, no support.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious why they ended up back in jail and we couldn\u2019t do anything about that through litigation.

  "215": "## How Did We Get Here?\r\n\r\nFood is Free Albuquerque began in August of 2014, almost by accident. Erin and Trista, both avid canners and food preservers, had seen many fruit trees around Albuquerque that appeared to be going unused. An ad placed on the local Craigslist asking for access to the unused fruit trees was about to play a critical role in their futures. Over the next few days the ladies, overwhelmed with all the responses, arranged their first harvest. To their surprise and delight the first pick yielded over 100 pounds of fruit; more than enough for their own families. Knowing there were other harvest opportunities, it was in that moment both knew they had fallen onto something that was bigger than them.\r\n\r\nThe Food is Free Project is a global movement started in Austin, Texas by John Vandeusen Edwards promoting front yard gardens and sharing the excess with the community. Using this project base Erin and Trista requested permission to use the Food is Free name to create their own local chapter.  A Facebook page was created, and just like that, their first harvest as Food is Free Albuquerque was complete. Discussion during harvesting lead to the \"What next?\" and \"Where on Earth would all these apples go?\" In the end, the decision was made; the first box was left at a busy city bus stop with a sign taped to it \"Free Apples.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known that groups need volunteers. Who were theirs? Trista and Erin's combined five home-schooled children were the first to jump in line.  Often times simply playing make believe games of childhood while the crazy moms grasped for apples.

  "220": "## Mission\n\n_Storehouse New Mexico is a nonprofit community-based food pantry that provides free food to people in need. _\n\nThe Storehouse became a nonprofit organization in 1976 with one specific goal: to help New Mexicans solve their food insecurities regardless of race, faith, age, gender, or disability. Hunger has increased over the years, and the Storehouse currently provides nutritious food to over 40,000 people a year.\n\n## History\n\nIn 1976, Titus and Charlotte Scholl, a local pastor and his wife, realized that too many people in Albuquerque were going hungry. Instead of standing by, they took it upon themselves to do something to help. They spoke to friends and family, gathered collections and began to distribute food out of the trunk of their car and occasionally their own garage. Many years later, when the Storehouse found its current home near the corner of Central and Broadway in downtown Albuquerque, the Storehouse was supporting close to 10,500 families.\n\nIn an effort to find more ways to end hunger in New Mexico, the Scholls founded the Roadrunner Food Bank in 1980. We have continued to worked closely together since then.\n\nThe Scholls, and eventually a team of volunteers, survived entirely on community support and the generous contributions of food and resources they were able to gather.\n\nAs a truly charitable organization, the Storehouse still relies almost entirely every month on the generosity of community members to remain in operation. A majority of those donations are given by individuals. Corporate gifts, foundations, and faith community donors are also vital.\n\n\nThe Scholl family wasn\u2019t especially well known or wealthy, they were just thoughtful people who wanted to \u201cprove someone cares\u201d. That mindset remains part of the social fabric of the Storehouse today. Our goal is for everyone who walks through our door to get nutritious food and the caring our our team. \n\nIn 2014, the Storehouse nearly closed. To ensure we could continued to feed the multitude of families that count on us, we turned to another nonprofit for support. At that time, Adelante Development Center began to support our administrative efforts such as fundraising, marketing, payroll, IT, and HR support.

Recognizing the value to the community of maintaining this agricultural space, the City passed a two-year \u00bc cent sales tax to provide funds for its acquisition.\r\n\r\nThe Farm holds a special place in the history of Albuquerque. It occupies the original site of Los Poblanos, one of the earliest Spanish Colonial settlements in the Rio Grande Valley. It is, in fact, a living link in an agricultural heritage that extends over 1700 years, making it among the oldest parcels of continually farmed land in the United States. Years of hard work have transformed the neglected land into community gardens, wildlife habitat, and certified organic croplands. These provide educational experiences, community service projects, recreation and entertainment to a broad segment of our population while honoring our history and protecting the environment. Recent studies have shown that agricultural lands contribute significantly to recharging Albuquerque\u2019s aquifer.

In addition to offering dedicated daily homework help, a key aspect of our program is the enrichment learning opportunities we provide through our own lesson plans.\r\n\r\nAll of our programs are located onsite at your child\u2019s school, making it convenient for parents by allowing for effective communication with school staff. Our team meets with the school\u2019s principal to learn where the school is strong academically, as well as to identify areas in which they\u2019d like to offer more. RGEC then customizes our after-school program to help augment the school\u2019s areas of weakness. Learning may include lessons in science, math, geography, literacy, and the arts. We also incorporate subjects that the school may have had to drop or minimize due to lack of funding, like music, fine art, performing arts and sports. Students begin their afternoon at RGEC with a snack or a lite meal right as soon as the school day has finished. Each after-school program is divided into two parts: homework help and enrichment time. During homework help, students are grouped with their grade level and may work on their homework on their own, or with the help of program educators. A key aspect of our programs is that they reduce the burden of homework on busy families, and increase the amount of family time each night. Students will finish homework before parents pick them up, freeing parents to focus on making dinner and talking with their children about the school day.\r\n\r\nNext, kids get to break into groups for our enrichment classes, which are fun, enhanced learning designed to augment the school\u2019s existing curriculum. During enrichment time, students will participate in planned group lessons and activities that have been selected to expand on the core subjects they learn in school. Kids are grouped by grade level, and the groups alternate between academic subjects like literacy, science and math, and other topics like entrepreneurship, nutrition, physical wellness and dramatic arts to name a few. These activities include reading and math practice that are part of our \u201cdisguised learning\u201d methods. All lessons are planned, structured, led by our trained instructors and many are also teachers and educational assistants at your child\u2019s school. All our program instructors are certified in CPR and First Aide and must pass a CYFD background check. Our programs are licensed through the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department to ensure that a high level of safety standards exist and the best practices are followed, providing a safe program for your child.

In response to the request, the Rio Grande Community Development Center (RGCDC) developed the Bridge and Isleta Boulevards Revitalization plan.

  "588": "## Keeping Families Close\r\n\r\nProviding family housing, meals, and support, just steps away from patient care.\r\n\r\nOur houses provide overnight stays to families seeking lifesaving treatments at local area hospitals. The guest rooms provide safe and comfortable spaces for families to rest and recharge together following long days at the hospital. More than a roof over their heads, these accommodations relieve families of the stresses of finding a place to stay while far from home. This allows parents to be stronger partners in their children\u2019s critical care.\r\n\r\n## RMHC History\r\n\r\nWorking as a pediatric oncologist at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia in the 1970s, Dr. Audrey E. Evans saw families spend night after night in the hospital while their children received life-saving medical treatment. She knew there had to be a better way and envisioned a house where families could stay during these stressful and uncertain times.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the Philadelphia Eagles were raising funds in support of player Fred Hill, whose daughter, Kim, was in treatment for leukemia at St. Christopher\u2019s Hospital for Children. Eagles\u2019 General Manager Jimmy Murray approached St. Christopher\u2019s about making a donation, Dr. Lawrence Naiman suggested there was an even greater need for funds resting with Dr. Evans. Mr. Murray met Dr. Evans and became a champion for her cause. He reached out to Eagles advertiser, McDonald\u2019s, with the idea that they could offer the proceeds from their Shamrock Shake sales to benefit this new house. McDonald\u2019s agreed, and the Philadelphia Ronald McDonald House was born on October 15, 1974. Today there are over 375 Ronald McDonald House Programs in 65 countries and regions across the world.\r\nvintage picture of sign telling of future ronald McDonald's house under construction\r\n\r\n## Local History\r\n\r\nOur Ronald McDonald House was a vision conceived in 1979 by a collaboration of three Albuquerque hospitals, as well as medical groups, private citizens, and the Junior League of Albuquerque. Seed funding ($25,000) from McDonald\u2019s Ray Kroc Fund was just the beginning. The group incorporated and established a volunteer board. The Junior League pledged time and money to build the House. Following extensive real estate searches, a 50-year lease was awarded by the UNM Board of Regents for the present site on UNM North Campus. The Ronald McDonald House on Yale Boulevard opened on October 30, 1982, with eight guest rooms. Eighteen months later, the House was already too small, and plans began to expand to meet the community need for family services. By December 1985, 10 bedrooms, 10 baths, a large living room, two solariums, more laundry space, and another kitchen were added. In March 1996, we began serving the community as Ronald McDonald House Charities of New Mexico (RMHC-NM) with a mission to provide temporary housing to families with ill children. In 2007, we opened the Ronald McDonald Family Room at UNM Children\u2019s Hospital, where we provide respite services outside the walls of the Ronald McDonald House. A year later, we completed the latest House expansion, increasing the number of family guestrooms from 18 to 30. The House now has the capacity to provide nearly 11,000 family lodging nights annually. Over the last several years, demand for RMHC-NM\u2019s support has increasingly exceeded its capacity, which means more and more families who hope to stay at the House are turned away because it is full. To address this critical need, a second Ronald McDonald House facility, the Highlands House, was opened across the street from Presbyterian Hospital within a Marriot SpringHill Suites Hotel. This first-of-a-kind endeavor provides an additional 20 guest rooms to our lodging program, allowing RMHC-NM to serve an additional 640 families annually.",

A place where delicious, affordable, and locally produced foods come together to nourish our community from the ground up.\r\n\r\n## Our Story\r\n\r\nFood nourishes us, connects us to our traditions and cultures, and creates jobs and economic opportunity in our communities. But limited access to fresh, healthy food, kitchen space, and entrepreneurial support has narrowed opportunities to meaningfully engage in local food systems. At Three Sisters Kitchen we believe that good food, health, and economic opportunity are for everyone. That is why we started our non-profit community food space, including a Cafe, Test Kitchen, Community Classroom, and Local Foods Shop. Three Sisters Kitchen makes fresh, local food accessible, affordable, and fun to cook, and creates pathways for food entrepreneurs to experiment and build businesses that succeed, contributing to a healthier and more vibrant community.\r\n\r\nThree Sisters Kitchen was born from community conversations hosted by the DowntownABQ MainStreet Initiative and the Downtown Growers Market from 2015- 2017 with residents, community-based organizations, social service agencies, and business owners. In response to a community articulated need, the idea for Three Sisters Kitchen emerged to create a warm, welcoming space that celebrates and supports local food producers year-round, promotes a healthy community, and offers meaningful opportunities to engage in the local food system.\r\n\r\nThree Sisters Kitchen fulfills a need and complements existing food and health programming in Albuquerque. Our spaces and our offerings support the incubation of new ideas and contribute towards our vision of a food-secure community with a vibrant culture of health and a deep commitment to food and economic justice.",

  "971": "\u200bFounded in 2013, Rio Rancho Creative Crossroads' (RRCC) mission is to bring high quality, reasonably priced cultural art to Rio Rancho. You heard me, right here in Rio Rancho. We focus on finding ways to introduce our members and our community to bigger, bolder, different, extraordinary artistic experiences you would never expect to get in Rio Rancho.\n\nYou may not recognize the name Rio Rancho Creative Crossroads, because you may know us by one of our program names. We have three chorale programs, Children's Chorus of Rio Rancho, Rio Rancho Youth Chorus, and our advanced chorus, Encore. We are also GenerARTistry, which helps local talents produce their art in an easily consumable fashion so they can use their gifts to gift their community. Our first project is called The Squeaky Shoes project. We helped local author Debbie Coston make a coloring book version of her story Stanley and the Squeaky Shoes and we will help her realize her passion, making sure every kid has a new pair of shoes for their first day of school. In November 2019, RRCC joined with Mel Sussman to bring a community theater group to town, Rio Rancho Players Community Theatre (RRP).  RRP is an all ages community theater that rehearses and performs in Rio Rancho!  In 2021, we launched the Children's Chorus of Rio Rancho.  Based on our RRYC model, this open, cooperative chorus for 2nd - 5th graders is extremely popular, filling to capacity in only it's first season! And in 2023 we launched Rio Rancho Art on the Mesa, an all ages art workshop series including Mini Monet, Draw All You Can, and Beginner Block Printing, etc.\n\nIf you are a lover of the arts, join us! RRCC is ready, willing, and able to build a diverse and thriving arts community inside our city limits. But we cannot do it alone. We need your help. We are always looking to partner with local businesses for sponsorship and support. We also collaborate/partner with non-profit organizations to create new experiences across different audiences.",
  "1024": "Founded in 1991, the mission of the Albuquerque Girl Choir is to provide a positive musical experience for girls as they learn music fundamentals through vocal training and performance in an upbeat, encouraging atmosphere.  As members learn to express their joy in music, they experience personal growth and increased self-confidence.  AGC is comprised of two groups that teach music fundamentals according to age and ability.  As girls progress, they gain increasing competence with a variety of musical styles and vocal abilities.  AGC is open to enrollment for any girl, grades 2nd - 12th, who loves to sing\u2026no auditions required.\r\n\r\n\r\n__The Prep Choir__ - is generally comprised of girls in 2nd - 4th grades.  Choir members learn music fundamentals such as rhythm, pitch, and vocal expression.

The Main Choir builds upon the fundamentals taught in the Prep Choir and utilizes a diverse repertoire of music including classical, contemporary, gospel, folk, patriotic, seasonal, and foreign songs to build understanding, experience, and confidence.
